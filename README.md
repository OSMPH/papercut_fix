**Manage your expectations**

The OpenStreetMap project is impossible without volunteers who contribute their time, skills, and other resources.

The primary goal of the repository is to document local map issues that typical users are unable to resolve. As a project largely governed by [do-ocracy](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=do-ocracy), you are encouraged to try to resolve the issue yourself, first and foremost: **[Fix the Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/fixthemap)**.

By posting a request here, you acknowledge that this repository is maintained by volunteers who also seek to create a better local map on OSM, but are not obligated to resolve any requests made herein, or follow any specific action or timeline.
